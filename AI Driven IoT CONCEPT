AI-Driven Smart Agriculture System Proposal**
Overview

This smart agriculture system leverages **IoT sensors** and **AI models** to optimize farming operations and **predict crop yields**, increasing productivity and sustainability.

1. Sensors Required.

| Sensor Type            | Purpose                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Soil Moisture Sensor   | Monitors water content in soil              |
| Temperature Sensor     | Measures ambient and soil temperature       |
| Humidity Sensor        | Assesses air moisture for plant health      |
| Light Sensor (LDR)     | Tracks sunlight exposure for photosynthesis |
| pH Sensor              | Monitors soil acidity/alkalinity            |
| Rainfall Sensor        | Measures precipitation                      |
| CO₂ Sensor             | Tracks greenhouse gas concentration         |
| NDVI Camera (optional) | Captures plant health imagery               |

2. AI Model for Crop Yield Prediction

* Model Type: Regression Model (e.g., Random Forest Regressor or LSTM for time-series)
* Inputs: Historical and real-time sensor data, weather patterns, crop type, fertilizer use
* Output: Estimated crop yield per hectare
*Training Data: Past crop yield data + corresponding sensor readings and environmental factors
